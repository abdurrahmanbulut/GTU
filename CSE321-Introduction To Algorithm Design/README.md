**Hw-4 Feedback:**

  Q1: complexity is incorrect. O(nm) would occur if you tried to find the maximum element in the map for example. But you are trying to find a "path" which is much more complicated than finding an integer in O(nm) time.
  Q3-b: it is a linear time solution as well.
  

**Hw-5 Feedback:**
  
  Q1: time complexity is not correct.
  Q2: no information about the days to buy/sell.
